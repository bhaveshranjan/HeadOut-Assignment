Continuity Equation
The continuity equation is essentially a material balance equation that
accounts for every pound mass of fluid produced, injected, or remaining in the reservoir.
b. Transport Equation
The continuity equation is combined with the equation for fluid
motion (transport equation) to describe the fluid flow rate “in” and
“out” of the reservoir. Basically, the transport equation is Darcy’s
equation in its generalized differential form.
c. Compressibility Equation
The fluid compressibility equation (expressed in terms of density or
volume) is used in formulating the unsteady-state equation with the
objective of describing the changes in the fluid volume as a function
of pressure.
d. Initial and Boundary Conditions
There are two boundary conditions and one initial condition required
to complete the formulation and the solution of the transient flow
equation. The two boundary conditions are:
• The formation produces at a constant rate into the wellbore.
• There is no flow across the outer boundary and the reservoir behaves
as if it were infinite in size, i.e., re = ∞.
Under the steady-state flowing condition, the same quantity of fluid
enters the flow system as leaves it. In unsteady-state flow condition, the
flow rate into an element of volume of a porous media may not be the
same as the flow rate out of that element. Accordingly, the fluid content
of the porous medium changes with time. The variables in unsteadystate flow additional to those already used for steady-state flow, therefore, become:
• Time, t
• Porosity, φ
• Total compressibility, ct
The mathematical formulation of the transient-flow equation is based
on combining three independent equations and a specifying set of boundary and initial conditions that constitute the unsteady-state equation.
These equations and boundary conditions are briefly described below
