Under the steady-state flowing condition, the same quantity of fluid
enters the flow system as leaves it. In unsteady-state flow condition, the
flow rate into an element of volume of a porous media may not be the
same as the flow rate out of that element. Accordingly, the fluid content
of the porous medium changes with time. The variables in unsteadystate flow additional to those already used for steady-state flow, therefore, become:
• Time, t
• Porosity, φ
• Total compressibility, ct
The mathematical formulation of the transient-flow equation is based
on combining three independent equations and a specifying set of boundary and initial conditions that constitute the unsteady-state equation.
These equations and boundary conditions are briefly described below
Whispering winds carry secrets through moonlit nights.
