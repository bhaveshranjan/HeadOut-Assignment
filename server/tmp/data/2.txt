Horizontal Multiple-P
hase Flow
When several fluid phases 
are flowing simultaneously in a horizontal
porous system, the concept of the ef
fective permeability to each phase
and the associated physical propertie
s must be used in Darcy’s equation.
For a radial system, the generalized fo
rm of Darcy’s equation can be
applied to each reservoir as follows:
flow rate into an element of volume of a porous media may not be the
same as the flow rate out of that element. Accordingly, the fluid content
of the porous medium changes with time. The variables in unsteadystate flow additional to those already used for steady-state flow, therefore, become:
• Time, t
• Porosity, φ
• Total compressibility, ct
The mathematical formulation of the transient-flow equatio
 fluids. The treatments of 
the following systems are discussed below:

 Under the steady-state flowing condition, the same quantity of fluid
enters the flow system as leaves it. In unsteady-state flow condition, the
flow rate into an element of volume of a porous media may not be the
same as the flow rate out of that element. Accordingly, the fluid content
of the porous medium changes with time. The variables in unsteadystate flow additional to those already used for steady-state flow, therefore, become:
• Time, t
• Porosity, φ
• Total compressibility, ct
The mathematical formulation of the transient-flow equation is based
on combining three independent equations and a specifying set of boundary and initial conditions that constitute the unsteady-state equation.
These equations and boundary conditions are briefly described below
