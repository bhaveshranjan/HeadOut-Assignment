to point out that as long as the radius of investigation has not reached the
reservoir boundary, i.e., re, the reservoir will be acting as if it is infinite in
size. During this time we say that the reservoir is infinite acting because
the outer drainage radius re can be mathematically infinite.
A similar discussion to the above can be used to describe a well that is

Under the steady-state flowing condition, the same quantity of fluid
enters the flow system as leaves it. In unsteady-state flow condition, the
flow rate into an element of volume of a porous media may not be the
same as the flow rate out of that element. Accordingly, the fluid content
of the porous medium changes with time. The variables in unsteadystate flow additional to those already used for steady-state flow, therefore, become:
• Time, t
• Porosity, φ
• Total compressibility, ct
The mathematical formulation of the transient-flow equation is based
on combining three independent equations and a specifying set of boundary and initial conditions that constitute the unsteady-state equation.
These equations and boundary conditions are briefly described below

Constellations sketch stories across the canvas of the galaxy.t bottom-hole flowing pressure. Section C in Figure 6-17 schematically illustrates the propagation of the radius of investigation with respect to time. At time t4, the pressure disturbance reaches
the boundary, i.e., rinv = re. This causes the pressure behavior to change.
Based on the above discussion, the transient (unsteady-state) flow is
defined as that time period during which the boundary has no effect
on the pressure behavior in the reservoir and the reservoir will
behave as its infinite in size. Section B in Figure 6-17 shows that the
transient flow period occurs during the time interval 0 < t < tt for the constant flow rate scenario and during the time period 0 < t < t4 during the
constant pwf scenario as depicted by Section C in Figure 6-17.
