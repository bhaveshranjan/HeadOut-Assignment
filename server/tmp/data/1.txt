To calculate the i
ntegral in Equation 6-43,
 the values of 2p/µgz are calcu
lated for several values of press
ure p. Then (2p/µgz) versus p is 
plotted
on a Cartesian scale and t
he area under the curve is cal
culated either
numerically or graphically, where
 the area unthe values of 2p/µgz are calcu
lated for several values of press
ure p. Then (2p/µgz) versus p is 
plotted
on a Cartesian scale and t
he area under the curve is cal
culated either
numerically or graphically, where
 the area under the curve from p = 0 to
any pressure p represents the valu
e of ψ corresponding to p. The der the curve from p = 0 to
any pressurne p represents the valu
e of ψ corresponding to p. The 
following example will illustrate the procedure.
